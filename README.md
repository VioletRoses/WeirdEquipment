# Weird Equipment [Fabric]
## A small Minecraft mod that adds somewhat strange (but useful!) equipment.
### Depends on [LambDynamicLights](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights)
### Currently the mod is very much in progress, but includes:
* Torch Bow: A bow that shoots torches, which are placed upon landing.
* Cactus Sword: A powerful early-game sword that slightly damages you with every hit
* Jack o'Helmet: A helmet that provides ambient light but very little protection - no more holding torches in your offhand!
* Flint & Shears: Does this one really need an explanation? (Not responsible for any accidental forest fires)
* Netherite Torch Pickaxe: A netherite pickaxe with a torch core attached to it. Right-clicking places torches at the cost of 5 durability.
* Dirt Sword: Does no damage, but try right-clicking on a zombie with it!
